# CAPSTONE

This is my team's graduation portfolio.
This app is Based on Google CloudVision API Example.
(I REMOVED API KEY on build.gradle. so to use this app, you must have your own API-Key.)

List of APIs used in this app:
 Google CloudVision API (Text Detection)
 Camera2 API (to use camera function)

Feature : 
  Text-Detecting (by using google vision API + Camera2 API) / 
  Photo classifying (text detection can help you to save your pictures with a path suitable.)
 
How to use this app:
  First, you can add a folder in which photos is saved.
  
  Second, (if you don't want to use OCR function, skip this step.) if you touch that folder you added,      you can add some keywords associated with this folder.
  here's an example) folder name : JAVA Programming , keywords : int, void, JVM etc...)
  By adding a keyword, this app can detect text in a photo and determine in which folder to save a         photo.
  
  Third, you can set a save path by two method : 
   1)Touch the folder that you want to set as a save path for 2~3 seconds. 
   2)Touch the switch on the upper right of the screen to turn it on to activate the OCR function, and then take a picture to determine the path to save the photo by using OCR function.
   
   
Multi-language is not supported yet, but I'll import it after I get a job...

Thank you.
